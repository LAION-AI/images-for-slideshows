This ultrarealistic high-quality photo shows a set of peavey, peavy (sic), and cant dog tools displayed in a modern, minimalist setting. The dark steel of the dog hook provides a sharp contrast to the bright background. These historical tools, often seen as artifacts of logging, are presented as objects of art and design, raising questions about history and craft, sparking reflection upon their initial purpose and modern form.
