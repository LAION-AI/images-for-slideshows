The stark contrast between the tourniquet's tightness and the limb's natural form powerfully illustrates life-saving intervention. The photorealistic textures emphasize the urgency of the situation, conveying both the gravity of the injury and the commitment to preserving life. The compression bandage is a secondary supportive measure.
